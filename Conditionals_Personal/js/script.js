// going to do something about movies perhaps since it would be a good fit to use a ternary
var name  = prompt("Why hello there visitor from another dimension. Who am I? no need to worry about that right now might I instead suggest you tell me your name?");
 console.log(name);

//validating the prompt
 if(name === "") {
     name = prompt("Please enter your name!");
 }






//just a simple alert
alert("Alright "+ name +", the theme of today is movies!!");

//going to ask about the users age then i'll prob make a ternary based on age with a movie selection or something of that sort

var age = prompt("say "+ name +", would you mind letting me know your age so I can suggest some movies for you?");
